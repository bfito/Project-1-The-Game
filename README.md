HACK THE PLANET: A DDOS SERVICE GAME
====================================

The name of the game is Hack the Planet, inspired on a line of Iain Softley's movie Hackers with Angelina Jolie, a classic, you should watch it. The games is a simple strategy game, typically vs AI but in this version player vs. player which has never been done very much to my dimsay due to lack of tutorials and developing this game. The goal is to destroy your opponent by getting control of nodes which are represented by devices such as computers or phones, the more nodes or devices you control the more attack power you weild.

The techologies used in ths game were kept to a bair minimum following the flow of the game design, dynamic, and code, but above all K.I.S.S. After this proyect and week, I have decided to get this acronym tattoed on my knuckles so I don't ever forget. Drama apart, HTML5, CSS3, JQUERY3.1.1, and my crappy but faithful Windows8 HP laptop that runs a light version of Ubuntu called Lubuntu.

No installation needed.

The only unsolved problem is the responsiveness of the site and I the user has a clicking rampage it breaks the game...

This is the end of this game, as I will put more bell and whistles once I'm done with Ironhack.

Keep it real, keep it K.I.S.S.!

Happy coding!
